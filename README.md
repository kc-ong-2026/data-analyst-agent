## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Docker** (20.10+) and **Docker Compose** (2.0+)
- **API Keys** for at least one LLM provider:
  - [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (Required for embeddings)
  - [Anthropic API Key](https://console.anthropic.com/) (Recommended for best results)
  - [Google AI API Key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) (Optional fallback)
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- At least **4GB RAM** available for Docker containers
- **10GB disk space** for Docker images and data

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/govtech-chat-assistant.git
cd govtech-chat-assistant
```

#### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create the backend environment file:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Edit `backend/.env` and add your API keys:

```bash
# Required: OpenAI for embeddings
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Recommended: Anthropic for best LLM performance
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Optional: Google as fallback provider
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...

# Database (default values work with docker-compose)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://govtech:govtech_dev@postgres:5432/govtech_rag

# Optional: LangSmith tracing (for debugging)
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=...
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=govtech-multi-agent-system
```

**⚠️ Important**: The OpenAI API key is required even if you're using Anthropic for LLM, because we use OpenAI embeddings for RAG.

#### 3. Configure LLM Settings (Optional)

Edit `backend/config/config.yaml` to customize:

```yaml
llm:
  default_provider: anthropic  # or openai, google

  providers:
    anthropic:
      default_model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
      temperature: 0.7
      max_tokens: 4096

      # Agent-specific models
      analytics_model: claude-opus-4-6  # Use Opus for analytics
      verification_model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929  # Fast model for verification

llm_fallback:
  enabled: true  # Enable automatic retry and fallback

rag:
  use_reranking: true  # Enable cross-encoder reranking
  use_bm25: true       # Use BM25 instead of PostgreSQL full-text
  confidence_threshold: 0.5  # Minimum score to load dataset
```

#### 4. Build and Start Services

**Option A: Production Mode** (optimized, no hot reload)

```bash
make build
make up
```

**Option B: Development Mode** (hot reload, better for development)

```bash
make dev
```

This will:
1. Build Docker images for frontend, backend, and database
2. Start PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
3. Start backend server on port 8000
4. Start frontend server on port 3000
5. Automatically ingest datasets into the database

#### 5. Verify Installation

Wait for all services to start (about 30-60 seconds), then check:

```bash
# Check service health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/config/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"healthy","database":"connected","vector_store":"ready"}
```

#### 6. Access the Application

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger UI)
- **Alternative Docs**: http://localhost:8000/redoc (ReDoc)

## 🎮 Running the Application

### Docker (Recommended)

#### Production Mode

```bash
# Start all services
make up

# View logs
make logs

# View backend logs only
make logs-backend

# Stop services
make down

# Clean up (remove containers and volumes)
make clean
```

#### Development Mode (with hot reload)

```bash
# Start development containers
make dev

# This enables:
# - Frontend: Vite hot module replacement (HMR)
# - Backend: uvicorn auto-reload on file changes
# - Database: persistent volume for data
```

### Local Development (without Docker)

If you prefer running services locally:

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys

# Start PostgreSQL (if not using Docker)
# Note: You need pgvector extension installed
# See: https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#installation

# Run migrations (if needed)
alembic upgrade head

# Start backend server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173
```

### Data Ingestion

The system automatically ingests datasets on first startup. To manually trigger ingestion:

```bash
# Via Docker
make ingest

# Or directly
docker-compose exec backend python -m app.services.ingestion.ingest_cli

# Local (without Docker)
cd backend
python -m app.services.ingestion.ingest_cli
```

**What happens during ingestion:**
1. Scans `dataset/` directory for CSV/Excel files
2. Extracts metadata (columns, year ranges, dimensions)
3. Generates embeddings using OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
4. Creates PostgreSQL full-text search vectors
5. Builds BM25 indexes and caches to disk
6. Creates IVFFlat vector indexes for fast similarity search

**Data ingestion takes 2-5 minutes** depending on dataset size and API rate limits.

### Database Access

```bash
# Open PostgreSQL shell
make db-shell

# Or directly
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U govtech -d govtech_rag

# Useful queries:
# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employment_dataset_metadata;
# SELECT file_name, description FROM employment_dataset_metadata;
# \dt  -- List all tables
```

### Running Tests Locally (without Docker)

```bash
cd backend

# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Open coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Test Best Practices

- **Fast Feedback**: Unit tests should run in <30 seconds
- **Mocking**: Integration tests mock LLM calls by default (save API credits)
- **Isolation**: Each test is independent (no shared state)
- **Fixtures**: Use pytest fixtures for common setup
- **Markers**: Tests are marked with `@pytest.mark.requires_llm` if they need real LLM calls

### Code Quality & Linting

**Backend** (Python - Ruff + Black):
```bash
cd backend

# Install linting tools
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run Ruff linter
ruff check .

# Auto-fix issues
ruff check . --fix

# Format code with Black
black .

# Check formatting without changes
black --check .
```

**Frontend** (TypeScript - ESLint):
```bash
cd frontend

# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Auto-fix issues
npm run lint -- --fix

# Type check
npx tsc --noEmit
```

**CI/CD**: All linting checks run automatically in GitHub Actions on every push.

## 👨‍💻 Development

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (hot reload)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Type check
npm run type-check
```

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # For testing

# Format code
black app/
isort app/

# Lint code
flake8 app/
mypy app/

# Run backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Database Migrations

```bash
# Create new migration
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"

# Apply migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Rollback migration
alembic downgrade -1
```

### Adding New Datasets

1. Place CSV/Excel files in `dataset/` directory
2. Run ingestion: `make ingest`
3. Verify ingestion: `make db-shell` and query metadata tables

### Code Style

- **Python**: Black + isort + flake8 + mypy
- **TypeScript**: ESLint + Prettier
- **Commit Messages**: Conventional Commits (feat, fix, docs, etc.)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Database connection failed"

**Symptom**: Backend logs show `asyncpg.exceptions.InvalidCatalogNameError`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose ps

# Recreate database
make down
make clean
make up
```

#### 2. "OpenAI API key not found"

**Symptom**: `ValueError: OpenAI API key not found in environment`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check environment file
cat backend/.env | grep OPENAI_API_KEY

# Ensure key is set
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." >> backend/.env

# Restart backend
docker-compose restart backend
```

#### 3. "No datasets found"

**Symptom**: Queries return "I couldn't find relevant datasets"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Run ingestion manually
make ingest

# Check if data was ingested
make db-shell
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employment_dataset_metadata;
```

#### 4. "Frontend can't connect to backend"

**Symptom**: Network error in browser console

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/api/config/health

# Check Docker networks
docker network ls
docker network inspect govtech_assignment_default

# Restart services
docker-compose restart
```

#### 5. "LLM request timeout"

**Symptom**: `ReadTimeout: Request timed out`

**Solution**:
- Check API key is valid
- Verify network connectivity
- Increase timeout in `config.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  llm:
    providers:
      anthropic:
        timeout: 60  # Increase from 30
  ```

#### 6. "Vector index not found"

**Symptom**: `InvalidParameterValue: ivfflat index not found`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Rebuild vector indexes
make db-shell

# Drop and recreate indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_employment_metadata_embedding;
CREATE INDEX idx_employment_metadata_embedding
ON employment_dataset_metadata
USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (lists = 100);
```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:

```bash
# Edit docker-compose.yml
environment:
  - LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Restart
docker-compose restart backend

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f backend
```
